Embedded systems are specialized computing systems designed for specific functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system. Unlike general-purpose computers like your PC, they are often resource-constrained, meaning they have limited processing power, memory, and energy.

You interact with dozens of embedded systems daily â€“ from microwaves and washing machines to medical devices and industrial controllers. They are the unsung heroes of modern technology, performing dedicated tasks reliably and efficiently.

Key characteristics include real-time operation, high reliability, and often, a close interaction with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Developing for embedded systems requires a deep understanding of both hardware and software.
