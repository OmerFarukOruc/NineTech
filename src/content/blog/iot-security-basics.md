The Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices, creating a vast attack surface. Security must be a primary consideration from the design phase. Basic principles include secure boot, ensuring the device only runs authentic firmware, and encrypted communication using protocols like TLS/SSL for data in transit.

Data at rest on the device should also be protected, potentially with encryption. Regular firmware updates are crucial to patch vulnerabilities. Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for device access and cloud communication. Consider physical security if devices are deployed in accessible locations.

Minimizing the attack surface by disabling unused services and ports is also good practice. While IoT security is complex, these foundational steps can significantly improve the resilience of your devices.
